this is a touchbar preset for FLStudio for BetterTouchTool/BTT.

I got the Inspiration from the following Reddit post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/roboo7/til_you_can_build_a_custom_touchbar_for_fl_using/

the following image shows the touch bar, if you open up fl studio.

the controls on the right are the ordinary controls from macos, wich you can also change in the settings of your mac.

if you wish to disable this controls for FLStudio (or any other aplication in BTT) you have to click on the app on the left in BTT and select the third option under "Touch Bar Configuration For:  (FL Studio 20)"
